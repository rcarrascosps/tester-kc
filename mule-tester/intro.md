In this scenario we'll learn how to install and use MuleSoft API Catalog to import APIs and Assets to MuleSoft Anypoint Exchange.

The pre-requisites for this scenario are:


-   **Anypoint Platform**  - You will need an Anypoint Platform account to catalog APIs to Anypoint Exchange. You can sign up for a free trial account  [here](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/#/signup?apintent=generic).
-   **API Catalog CLI permissions**  - Enable the  **API Catalog Contributor**  permission in Anypoint Platform. For detailed instructions, see  [Before You Begin](https://docs.mulesoft.com/exchange/apicat-get-started#configure-api-catalog-cli-permissions).
-   **Acquire Organization ID**  - Log in to  [Anypoint Platform](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/)  and go to API Manager. Click on the Environment Information button to retrieve your  **Business Group ID**  (or Organization ID).
-   **NodeJS**  and  **npm**  - You will need to install the latest LTS version. You can download both NodeJS and npm  [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
-   **Code Editor**  - You will need to install  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)  (recommended as we will use this in part 2 of the tutorial) or other code editing software to edit the Descriptor file.
-   **Project files**  - Download the  `Follow Tutorial`  folder as a zip file from the  **API Catalog CLI**  example repository below and place the contents unzipped in an accessible location.
